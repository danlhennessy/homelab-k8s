Create a temp cluster manually (minikube, kind, rancher-desktop etc)

Install Crossplane and kubectl a cloud cluster (AKS/GKE/EKS)

Access the cloud cluster, install Crossplane and apply the same manifest that created the cloud cluster

The cloud cluster can then manage itself, as well as other clusters - dev / prod etc
